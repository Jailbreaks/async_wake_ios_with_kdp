### KDP kernel debugger for iOS 11.1.2 by @i41nbeer

!!! DO NOT USE THIS ON A PERSONAL DEVICE !!!

Only use this on a dedicated testing device.

If you want more technical details about how this works please see the slides from my MOSEC 2018
talk: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1417#c16

The source should hopefully be reasonably well commented too :)

== prerequisites ==
out-of-the box this will only work on iPhone 7, iPhone 6s and iPod Touch 6g running
build 15B202 (11.1.2) You can make it work on all other devices on iOS 11 - 11.1.2
but will need to manually find the relativly large number of symbols which are required.

See symbols.c for hints on how to do this.

You will also need an uncompressed kernelcache binary. You can use the ipsw.me site
to find links to the correct ipsw package for your device. Unzip the ipsw then use
the joker tool from http://www.newosxbook.com/tools/joker.html to extract an uncompressed
kernelcache image.

You'll need to use lldb to connect to the debugger. The version which ships with the latest
Xcode on MacOS works fine. You can probably get this all to work on linux if you build lldb,
but I haven't tested that.

== debugger limitations ==
There are some severe limitations on what this debugger can do, but I have still found it
useful for VR and exploitation.

You can only debug the kernel when it's executing after your userspace thread has context-switched
in to EL1. Essentially this means you can only debug syscalls which *you* make. You cannot for example
set a breakpoint on kalloc and expect it to be hit every time the kalloc code is executed.
It will only be hit when a syscall you made caused kalloc to be hit.

Furthermore, the "debuggable" syscalls have to be made via a wrapper function.

== syscall wrapping ==
Only syscalls made by this syscall wrapper function will be visible to the debugger:

  void run_syscall_under_kdp(uint32_t syscall_number, uint64_t* retval, uint32_t n_args, ...);

syscall number is the number of the syscall to make (when I say syscall here I mean all SVC initiated
exceptions to EL1, so this includes platform syscalls, mach traps and unix syscalls.)

retval should be a pointer to an array of two uint64_t's to receive the return value of the syscall.
See the comments in do_syscall_with_pstate_d_unmasked for a more detailed discussion of syscall return
values and how to use the retval values to correctly wrap syscalls.

n_args is the number of arguments the syscall takes, then each argument should be passed.

I have included an example of how to wrap all the iokit MIG functions to make them debuggable. This lets
you debug IOKit external methods for example. See the wrapped version of mach_msg_trap in kdbg_syscall_wrappers.c
and the patched MIG-generated source from iokit's device.defs in iokitUser.c.

(Note that IOKitLib implements a higher-level wrapper on top of this, you'll have to patch that too if you want to use
IOKitLib's higher-level functions like IOConnectCallMethod rather than the actual MIG io_connect_method function.)

== building ==
If you put your target code in kernel_debug_me.c inside kernel_debug_me() the KDP server will already be set up, just
put your wrapped syscall invocations in there and KDP should see them.

This version of the async_wake exploit persists its kernel memory read/write port over app restarts (in a very hacky way,
see persist_tfp0.h.) The first time you run this app it will get kernel memory r/w. Quit it and run it again to start
the KDP server with the persisted kernel memory r/w port.

== connecting: setup ==
KDP is a udp-based protocol. kdp_server.c implements a subset of the server side of the KDP protocol.

If SERVER_MODE_TCP is defined (which it is by default) it will actually talk tcp, wrapping each udp packet in a simple <length, value>
protocol. This means you can use it over a tcp relay via a lightning cable rather than having to talk over
a real network interface.

I have included usbmux.py and tcprelay.py from Hector Martin "marcan". If you're running on MacOS those are enough
to set up tcp port forwarding. If you're running linux search for a guide on how to get tcp port forwarding working.

On a mac connect your target iDevice via lightning cable then in a terminal on the host run:
$ python usbmux.py

In another host terminal run:
$ python ./tcprelay.py -t 41139:41414

that sets up a port forward from 41139 on the iDevice on 41414 on the host.

Then build and run async_wake_ios and run it twice; first to run the exploit to get kernel memory r/w then quit it and run again to
start the KDP server.

Then in another host terminal run:
$ python kdpproxy.py localhost

that will start a simple python script which listens for kdp udp packets on localhost 41139, wraps them in TCP packets and sends them to
localhost 41414. It also receives and unwraps packets going the other way.

(You can avoid all this proxying by undefining SERVER_MODE_TCP, but then you'll have to have your iDevice and debugging client on the same
network where they can send udp packets to each other.)

== connecting: lldb ==
You need the uncompressed kernelcache image for your target device. Running file on that should say "Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64", not "data".

In a host terminal window run:
$ lldb <your.uncompressed.kernelcache>

That should drop you to an lldb prompt, run this there:
(lldb) kdp-remote localhost

[if you're not using the tcp wrapper, replace localhost with the iDevice's ip address]

If all the networking is set up correctly you should see something like this:

Version: Darwin Kernel Version 17.2.0: Fri Sep 29 18:14:50 PDT 2017; root:xnu-4570.20.62~4/RELEASE_ARM64_T8010; UUID=5E450F40-E224-33F7-946B-A764D21DF3FC; stext=0xfffffff00b004000

followed by a long list of all the kexts for which you don't have symbols before you get dropped back at an lldb prompt:

(lldb)

Note that the kernel isn't actually stopped here; this is an emulated stop state because of how the lldb client and server expect stuff to work.
You can't single step from here, but you can set breakpoints. Once those breakpoints are hit single-stepping works fine.

== using lldb ==
There are a few idosyncracies to be aware of when using lldb in this setup:

== using lldb: stepping and continuing ==
If you just use the lldb 'c' and 's' continue and step-instruction instructions you will lose control via KDP.
Instead when you first connect you need to create the following two aliases:

(lldb) command alias kc process plugin packet send -c 27
(lldb) command alias ks process plugin packet send -c 28

then to continue execution when stopped do this:
(lldb) kc
(lldb) c

and to single-step do this:
(lldb) ks
(lldb) s

The reason for this is that the lldb client code tries to resume execution by indicating that the client should do a hardware single-step
but this doesn't make it to the ARM64 register layer so it's impossible to distinguish whether the client
wanted to really remove a breakpoint or is just temporarily removing a breakpoint to single-step over it. (I don't think Apple use this code.)

The kc and ks commands tell the KDP server that we plan to continue or single-step, so it should ignore the next breakpoint_remove command it receives.

== using lldb: setting breakpoints ==
This works as expected, either via address or symbol if lldb knows about the symbol.

(lldb) break set --address 0xfffffff00a8c8484

Remember to rebase any kernelcache addresses using the current slide value (lldb tells you this when you connect.)

You are limited to 16 hardware breakpoints. The KDP server will also internally use some breakpoints to implement the continue and single-step
features, so don't use all of them. If you do things will probably break in weird ways.

When breakpoints are hit you can do the usual things like viewing registers and memory.

== using lldb: single-stepping ==
This should work well using the hardware single-step feature. Remember that you need to do 'ks' and then 's', not just 's'.

== using lldb: finish ==
This should work and step you out of the current function.

== using lldb: next ==
This doesn't work yet, sorry. It could be made to work with some effort, but for now you'll have to manually set the correct breakpoints.

== using lldb: detach ==
This doesn't really work.

== using lldb: watchpoints ==
If you are very very keen you could make these work; but for now they won't.

== newer iOS versions ==
At some point after iOS 11.1.2 Apple tried to mitigate the techniques this debugger uses. Specifically the gadget which I use to set MDSCR_EL1
has changed such that it attempts to verify that the value it set didn't set the KDE bit. This mitigation can probably be defeated
but for the next iteration of this project I would probably use a different technique for making everything work.

== bugs ==
I am sure this thing is very buggy; I can't believe it works at all. It does mostly work though ;)
